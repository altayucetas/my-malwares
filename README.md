# Simple Malware Repo
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I created this repository with the aim of both motivating myself and creating a guide for people who are new to this field, like me, about Malware Development, which I think is an intersection of the software field that I am developing myself and the cybersecurity field that I have been interested in for a long time. The resources here are designed for both the red team and the blue team to review and find solutions to problems. Also, the resources here are purely for educational purposes and should never be used for any malicious purpose.
